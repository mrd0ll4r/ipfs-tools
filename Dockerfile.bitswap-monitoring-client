# Implements an image to run the bitswap-monitoring-client tool.
# This will expose port 8088 for prometheus.
# The executable is placed in /, the config in /config/.
# The config is copied from the builder stage (and thus verbose from the sources).
# You can probably overwrite it by mounting your own config directory, I guess.

# Get some small base image to run things on.

# Create a system user to drop into.
# This will get some small (<1000) UID and GID, which is fine since we don't write to any files on the host.
